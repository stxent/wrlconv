Script requires python-2.7, python-numpy, python-imaging and python-opengl packages. Optionally inkscape and xmlto packages should be installed.
Viewer now supports direct import from FreeCAD and import from Blender through X3D format. For Blender "Export X3D Hierarchy" option should be disabled.


Internal VRML viewer usage examples
  wrload.py -v FILE   View model in internal viewer.
  wrload.py -w FILE   Save model with VRML syntax, similar to Wings3D.
  wrload.py -h        More info.


Board export examples
  In pcbnew:
    Plot silk, mask, copper and edge cuts layers to SVG format to the project folder. "Exclude PCB edges" options does not matter.
    Place origin point at the upper left corner and create drill file with options: units "mm", format "Gerber", "Mirror y axis", drill origin "Auxiliary axis".

  Convert SVG images to diffuse texture and normal map:
  rasterizer.py -i ~/project_name
  When project name prefix differs from the specified project directory, project name can be specified with -p switch:
  rasterizer.py -i ~/input_dir -p project_name

  Generate board model and save VRML file with extended VRML syntax to view in internal viewer:
  b2m.py -i ~/project_name
  Generate model to import in FreeCAD, Blender or other program:
  b2m.py -i ~/project_name --format kicad

  Show resulting 3D model in internal viewer:
  wrload.py -v ~/project_name/project_name.wrl


Some exporting tricks
  Export multiple packages from single Blender model file:
